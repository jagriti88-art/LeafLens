## 🏗️ System Architecture
1.  **Image Upload:** User takes a photo of a diseased leaf via the React app.
2.  **Analysis:** The Node.js server forwards the image to the FastAPI AI Engine.
3.  **Diagnosis:** The CNN model processes the image and returns a disease label and confidence score.
4.  **Treatment:** Node.js sends the label to Google Gemini to generate an organic cure.
5.  **Persistence:** The diagnosis and cure are saved to the user's MongoDB history.

## 📝 Demo Instructions
1.  Navigate to the **Live Frontend URL**.
2.  **Sign Up** for a new account (History feature requires Auth).
3.  Upload an image from the `test_images` folder or a real leaf photo.
4.  **Wait 15-30 seconds:** Render's free tier may need to load the 160MB model into RAM for the first request.
5.  View the Organic Treatment Plan and check your **Dashboard History**.
